<objective>
Create all phases necessary to close gaps identified by `/gsd-audit-milestone`.

Reads MILESTONE-AUDIT.md, groups gaps into logical phases, creates phase entries in ROADMAP.md, and offers to plan each phase.

One command creates all fix phases — no manual `/gsd-add-phase` per gap.

<execution_context>
@$HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/plan-milestone-gaps.md
</execution_context>

<context>
**Audit results:**
Glob: .planning/v*-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md (use most recent)

Original intent and current planning state are loaded on demand inside the workflow.
</context>

<process>
Execute the plan-milestone-gaps workflow from @$HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/plan-milestone-gaps.md end-to-end.
Preserve all workflow gates (audit loading, prioritization, phase grouping, user confirmation, roadmap updates).
